# Separable effects for adherence

# Introduction
Here we provide the code to reproduce the simulated data example in: Wanis KN, Stensrud MJ, Sarvet AL. Separable Effects for Adherence.

# Organization
- `main_sim.R` — R file which creates a simulated dataset and then applies the estimation algorithm described in the text to compute the total and separable effects.
- `src_sim` — Folder containing scripts including main functions for producing simulated data.
- `figures` — Folder containing outputs from `main_sim.R`.
